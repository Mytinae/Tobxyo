- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mytinae
- 👀 I’m interested in anything IT, gaming, outdoors
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on about anything to further advance me in IT/life
- 📫 How to reach me: Mainly via discord, as I don't use other apps much and don't read any of my thousands of emails. My discord is: ntrx.tob
- 😄 Pronouns: Any, not really bothered
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been interested in IT basically my whole life! Before I could even remember stuff! (My sister had to tell me that I was into IT even then cause I didn't know xd). I am 15 as of 2024, and I am a freelancer!
- 💻 Feel free to reach out to me if you are looking to have a website made cheaply, although I have a smol problem with deadlines. Keep in mind I am still learning so it might not look the best (hence the low price).
